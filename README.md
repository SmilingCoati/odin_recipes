Basic Recipe Website

In this project a website is build which will consist of a main page
with links to several recipes. For this basic HTML knowledge is used.
Thus the website won't look fancy nor have any special functions yet.
This project will help to practice the basics of HTML like building
the header, linking other websites or pictures. Later the project will
be revisited to improve the website with some CSS.
